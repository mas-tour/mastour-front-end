# MasTour

## About This Project
Hiring a tour guide for a trip can be challenging for tourists, as they often have to go through travel agencies that often offer limited options and take visitors to popular tourist spots they have affiliations with to boost their revenue. This approach may not offer an authentic and personalized experience of the local culture and ‘hidden gems’. To solve this problem, MasTour has been developed. 

MasTour connects tourists directly with local freelance tour guides, providing a more **personalized** and **authentic** travel experience. This application aims to promote hidden gem destinations that are not typically included in mainstream travel itineraries, enabling travelers to explore and appreciate the cultural and natural richness of each destination while supporting local tourism growth. 

**With MasTour, travelers can enjoy a unique and unforgettable travel experience while supporting local tourism growth.**
